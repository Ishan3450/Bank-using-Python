# Bank-using-Python
Created a Bank program using Python working with file system which will create a bank account and also a digital card and store info in it.

Using this Project I got understanding of various concepts like:
  - How Object Oriented Programming works in Python.
  - Program flow of Python.
  - Conditionals
  - CRUD operations in File System

Folders:
  - accInfo: stores the account number named file and user information in it.
  - cardsInfo: stores the card number named file and user and account info in it.
  
.py files:
  - main.py is the main bank program file
  - try.py is the test file to get the output of not sure inputs and various in-built methods.
